So I started this account a while ago, just in case I would need it any time soon.
It turns out, I was mainly using GitHub as a source for my own projects.

Now I decided it is time to share some of my work with anyone who might care.
And as a start I am going to rewrite this starting page of mine.

Just visit it <a href="http://www.weber.xyz" target="_blank">here</a>.
