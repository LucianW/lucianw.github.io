        <h1>Lucian Weber - GitHub</h1>
        <h3>I Welcome you to my GitHub Account.</h3>
        <div style="margin: 10px 0;">
            This will from now on be the new home for projects that I am working on in my free time.
        </div>
        <div style="margin: 10px 0;">
            There already are some projects lying on my harddisc that are waiting to be released.<br />
            The problem is, that most of the time I am using proprietary APIs for which an secret APIkey is needed. And since I am not willing to share my private keys, I will need to find a solution that allows anyone to instantly use my projects and at the same time keeping my keys secret.
        </div>
        <div style="margin: 10px 0;">
            As soon as I found time to solve this problem, I will show my projects to anyone who is or is not interested. :-D
        </div>
        <div style="margin: 10px 0;">
            If you have questions or suggestions for improvements on current projects or even ideas for completely new projects, feel free to drop me an email.
